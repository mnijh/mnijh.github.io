The tabulated equation of state (EoS) contains data for density, adiabatic temperature gradient, entropy, internal energy and bulk speed of sound on a pressure temperature grid. It combines the EoS of Mazevet et al. (2019) with EoS at lower temperatures and pressures, namely:

+ Feistel & Wagner (2006) (Ice Ih)
+ Journaux et al. (2020) (Ice II, III, V, VI)
+ French & Redmer (2015) (Ice VII, X)
+ Wagner & Pruss (2002) (liquid and gas, below 1 GPa and below 1200 K)
+ Brown (2018) (liquid above 1 GPa, below 10'000 K)
+ CEA package by Gordon (1994) and McBride (1996)
