I"ç<p>Context. Exoplanet characterisation is one of the main foci of current exoplanetary science. For super-Earths and sub-Neptunes,
we mostly rely on mass and radius measurements, which allow to derive the body‚Äôs mean density and give a rough estimate of the
planet‚Äôs bulk composition. However, the determination of planetary interiors is a very challenging task. In addition to the uncertainty
in the observed planets‚Äô fundamental parameters, theoretical models are limited due to the degeneracy in determining the planetary
composition.</p>

<p>Aims. We aim to study several aspects that affect internal characterization of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes: observational uncertainties, location on the M-R diagram, impact of additional constraints as bulk abundances or irradiation, and model assumptions.
More specifically, we first study the effect of data uncertainty on the inferred the internal structure of planets of different masses,
radii, insolations, and bulk Fe/Si and Mg/Si ratios. Then we study the effect of using different masses for fixed radius from different
published M-R relationships to infer the internal structure. Finally, we study how variations on the planet‚Äôs temperature profile affect
the inferred M-R relationship and whether the theoretical uncertainty related model assumptions can eventually be comparable to the
observational one.</p>

<p>Methods. We use a full probabilistic Bayesian inference analysis that accounts for observational and model uncertainties. We employ a Nested Sampling scheme to efficiently produce the posterior probability distributions for all the planetary structural parameter of interest. We include the state-of-the-art structural model presented in Dorn et al. (2017), which is based on self-consistent thermody-
namics of core, mantle, high-pressure ice, liquid water, and H-He envelope.</p>

<p>Results. Regarding the effect of mass and radius uncertainties on the determination of the internal structure, we find three different
regimes: below the Earth-like composition line and above the pure-water composition line smaller observational uncertainties lead
to better determination of the core and atmosphere mass respectively, and between them internal structure characterization does
not depend on the observational uncertainties. We also find that using the stellar Fe/Si and Mg/Si abundances as a proxy for the bulk
planetary abundances does not always provide additional constraints on the internal structure, it depends on the measured abundances.
Finally we also find that small variations in the temperature or entropy profiles lead to radius variations that are comparable to the
observational uncertainty. This suggests that uncertainties linked to model assumptions can eventually become more relevant to
determine the internal structure than observational uncertainties.</p>
