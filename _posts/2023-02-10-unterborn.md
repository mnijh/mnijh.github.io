The two primary observable quantities of an exoplanet—its mass and radius—alone are not sufficient to probe a
rocky exoplanet’s interior composition and mineralogy. To overcome this, host-star abundances of the primary
planet-building elements (Mg, Si, Fe) are typically used as a proxy for the planet’s bulk composition. The majority
of small exoplanet hosts, however, do not have available abundance data. Here we present the open-source
ExoPlex mass–radius–composition solver. Unlike previous open-source mass–radius solvers, ExoPlex calculates
the core chemistry and equilibrium mantle mineralogy for a bulk composition, including effects of mantle FeO
content, core light elements, and surface water/ice. We utilize ExoPlex to calculate the planetary radii, surface
gravities, and bulk densities for $10^6$ model planets up to 2 R$_\oplus$ across these geochemistries, adopting the distribution
of FGK stellar abundances to estimate of the range of bulk exoplanet compositions. We outline the 99.7%
distribution of radii, surface gravities, and bulk densities that define planets as “nominally rocky.” Planets outside
this range require compositions outside those expected from stellar abundance data, likely making them either Fe-
enriched super-Mercuries, or volatile-enriched mini-Neptunes. We apply our classification scheme to a sample of
85 well-resolved exoplanets without available host-star abundances. We estimate only nine planets are within the
“nominally rocky planet zone” at $>70\%$ confidence, while $\sim20\% $ and $\sim30\%$ of this sample can be reasonably
classified as super-Mercuries or volatile-rich, respectively. Our results provide observers with a self-consistent way
to classify broadly a planet as likely rocky, Mercury-like, or volatile-enriched, using mass and radius
measurements alone.
